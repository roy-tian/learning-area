# JavaScript loops marking guide

这些题目旨在检验对以下内容的理解： the JavaScript features covered in the [Looping code](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code) lesson in Learn Web Development on MDN.

注意：如果代码中出现错误，错误会输出到页面的结果面板中, to help you try to figure out the answer (or into the browser's JavaScript console, 对于可下载版本则会输出到浏览器的 JavaScript 控制台中).

Note: We didn't provide live editable versions of these tasks because of the risk of creating infinite loops and crashing the assessment page.

## Task 1

In our first looping task we want you start by creating a simple `for...of` loop that goes through all the items in the provided `myArray` and prints them out on the screen inside list items, which are appended to the provided `list`.

Note that using a `for()` loop would also be acceptable, as would a different loop structure such as `while()`.

The finished code should look something like this:

```js
const myArray = ["tomatoes", "chick peas", "onions", "rice", "black beans"];

const list = document.createElement("ul");

for (let item of myArray) {
  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  listItem.textContent = item;
  list.appendChild(listItem);
}
```

## Task 2

In this next task, we want you to write a simple program that, given a name, searches an array of objects containing names and emails (`phonebook`) and, if it finds the name, outputs the name and phone number and then uses `break` to exit the loop.

If the name is not found, it lets the user know.

You should use a type of loop that you've not used in the previous task.

The finished code should look something like this:

```js
const name = "Mustafa";
const para = document.createElement("p");

const phonebook = [
  { name: "Chris", number: "1549" },
  { name: "Li Kang", number: "9634" },
  { name: "Anne", number: "9065" },
  { name: "Francesca", number: "3001" },
  { name: "Mustafa", number: "6888" },
  { name: "Tina", number: "4312" },
  { name: "Bert", number: "7780" },
  { name: "Jada", number: "2282" },
];

// 在此处添加代码
for (let i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
  if (phonebook[i].name === name) {
    para.textContent = `${phonebook[i].name}的电话号码是 ${phonebook[i].number}.`;
    break;
  }

  if (i === phonebook.length - 1) {
    para.textContent = "Name not found in the phonebook";
  }
}
```

## Task 3

Finally, you'll need to use a loop to go through the numbers 1 to 500, backwards, and run the `isPrime()` function on them. For each number that isn't a prime number, use the `continue` keyword to move on to the next loop iteration. For each one that is a prime number, add it to the paragraph's `textContent`.

You should use a type of loop that you've not used in the previous two tasks.

The code should look something like this:

```js
do {
  if (isPrime(i)) {
    para.textContent += `${i} `;
  }
  i--;
} while (i > 1);
```
