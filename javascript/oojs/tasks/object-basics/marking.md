# JavaScript object basics marking guide

这些题目旨在检验对以下内容的理解： the JavaScript features covered in the [JavaScript object basics](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics) lesson in Learn Web Development on MDN.

注意：如果代码中出现错误，错误会输出到页面的结果面板中, to help you try to figure out the answer (or into the browser's JavaScript console, 对于可下载版本则会输出到浏览器的 JavaScript 控制台中).

## Task 1

In this task you are provided with an object literal, and your tasks are to

- Store the value of the `name` property inside `catName`, using bracket notation.
- Run the `greeting()` method using dot notation (it will log the greeting to the browser DevTools' console).
- Update the `color` property value to `black`.

The finished code should look something like this:

```js
const cat = {
  name: "Bertie",
  breed: "Cymric",
  color: "white",
  greeting: function () {
    console.log("喵！");
  },
};

const catName = cat["name"];
cat.greeting();
cat.color = "black";
```

## Task 2

In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favourite bands. The required members are:

- `name`: A string representing the band name.
- `nationality`: A string representing the country the band comes from.
- `genre`: What type of music the band plays.
- `members`: A number representing the number of members the band has.
- `formed`: A number representing the year the band formed.
- `split`: A number representing the year the band split up, or `false` if they are still together.
- `albums`: An array representing the albums released by the band. Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
  - `name`: A string representing the name of the album.
  - `released`: A number representing the year the album was released.

Include at least two albums in the `albums` array.

Once you've done this, you should then write a string to the variable `bandInfo`, which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, years active, and style, and the title and release date of their first album.

The finished code should look something like this:

```js
let bandInfo;

const band = {
  name: "黑色 Sabbath",
  nationality: "British",
  genre: "heavy metal",
  members: 4,
  formed: 1968,
  split: 2017,
  albums: [
    {
      name: "黑色 Sabbath",
      released: 1970,
    },
    {
      name: "Paranoid",
      released: 1970,
    },
    {
      name: "Master of Reality",
      released: 1971,
    },
    {
      name: "Vol. 4",
      released: 1972,
    },
  ],
};

bandInfo = `The ${band.nationality} ${band.genre} band ${band.name} were active ${band.formed}–${band.split}. Their first album, ${band.albums[0].name}, was released in ${band.albums[0].released}.`;
```

## Task 3

In this task we want you to return to the `cat` object literal from Task #1. We want you to rewrite the `greeting()` method so that it logs "Hello, said Bertie the Cymric." to the browser DevTools' console, but in a way that will work across _any_ cat object of the same structure, regardless of its name or breed.

When you are done, write your own object called `cat2`, which has the same structure, exactly the same `greeting()` method, but a different `name`, `breed`, and `color`.

Call both `greeting()` methods to check that they log appropriate greetings to the console.

The code should look like this:

```js
const cat = {
  name: "Bertie",
  breed: "Cymric",
  color: "white",
  greeting: function () {
    console.log(`你好，我是${this.name}，一只${this.breed}。`);
  },
};

const cat2 = {
  name: "Elfie",
  breed: "Aphrodite Giant",
  color: "ginger",
  greeting: function () {
    console.log(`你好，我是${this.name}，一只${this.breed}。`);
  },
};

cat.greeting();
cat2.greeting();
```

## Task 4

In this task we want you to update the code from Task 3 to use a constructor for the cats, so we only have to define `greeting()` once.

The code should look like this:

```js
function Cat(name, breed, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.color = color;
  this.greeting = function () {
    console.log(`你好，我是${this.name}，一只${this.breed}。`);
  };
}

const cat = new Cat("Bertie", "Cymric", "white");
const cat2 = new Cat("Elfie", "Aphrodite Giant", "ginger");

cat.greeting();
cat2.greeting();
```
